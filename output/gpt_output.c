Here is a cleaned-up version of the C code that preserves the original logic from the decompiled pseudocode:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    unsigned int num1, num2;
    
    printf("Enter the first number: ");
    scanf("%u", &num1);  // Changed to standard scanf
    printf("Enter the second number: ");
    scanf("%u", &num2);  // Changed to standard scanf
    
    printf("The sum of %u and %u is: %u\n", num1, num2, num1 + num2);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Library Inclusion**: Included `<stdio.h>` for `printf` and `scanf`.
2. **Data Types and Variables**: Changed `local_18` and `local_14` to `num1` and `num2` for clarity.
3. **Removed Unused Functions**: Removed functions related to initialization, stack protection, and exception handling, maintaining only the essential parts for the primary functionality.
4. **Simplified `scanf`**: Used standard `scanf` instead of the custom one in the pseudocode.
5. **Better Readability**: Used proper C conventions and formatting to improve code readability. 

This should maintain the functionality observed in the original pseudocode while presenting it in a more human-readable form.
