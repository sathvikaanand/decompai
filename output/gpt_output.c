Hereâ€™s a cleaned-up version of the original C code that closely resembles the logic and structure intended by the original programmer based on the provided Ghidra decompiled pseudocode:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    unsigned int first_number;
    unsigned int second_number;

    printf("Enter the first number: ");
    scanf("%u", &first_number);  // Using %u for unsigned integers
    printf("Enter the second number: ");
    scanf("%u", &second_number);

    printf("The sum of %u and %u is: %u\n", first_number, second_number, first_number + second_number);
    return 0;
}
```

### Comments on Changes Made:
1. **Function Prototypes**: Removed unnecessary `_init`, `_FINI_0`, `_INIT_0`, and other linkage functions which are not part of user-defined logic.
2. **Error Handling**: Stack protection functions and other system functions for terminating the program were also stripped, as they typically handle memory safety and are not part of the main logical flow for a simple program.
3. **Type Adjustments**: Updated types in `scanf` to match that of constant integers (`%u` for unsigned integers) for clarity.
4. **Standard Libraries**: Included the appropriate header `<stdio.h>` for `printf` and `scanf` functions.
5. **Structure**: Maintained clear logical flow and formatting that is standard in C/C++. 

This code represents the intended arithmetic functionality based on user input with an appropriate output display for the sum of two numbers.
